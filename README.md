# Intra-annual urbanness
Investigating intra-annual urbanness patterns using a trait-based approach in North American birds.

Writing the paper here: https://www.overleaf.com/project/5d2e5ef80778207052220560

## Step 1: Get list of potential species from US/North America
- A species must have a minimum of 250 observations in each month
- This is after filtering of the overall eBird dataset

## Step 2: Download species-level data for each species which meets the criteria

## Step 3: Create response variables
- Urbanness scores for each of 12 months
  - defined as the median of the histogram for a species
- Resampled edf in the wiggliness of a species for day of the year

## Step 4: Collate predictor variables
