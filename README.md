# Intra-annual urbanness
Investigating intra-annual urbanness patterns using a trait-based approach in North American birds

# Step 1: Get list of potential species from US/North America
## A species must have a minimum of 250 observations in each month
## This is after filtering of the overall eBird dataset

# Step 2: Download species-level data for each species which meets the criteria

# Step 3: Create response variables
## Urbanness scores for each of 12 months
## Resampled edf in the wiggliness of a species for day of the year

# Step 4: Collate predictor variables
